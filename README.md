# Kinda96_Keyboard
Kinda a 96% keyboard, except the numpad is removable (and located on the left side) and there's a split spacebar. Also, it's wired/wireless thanks to the TinyPico Nano.

There are three KiCAD projects here, each with a different keyboard.

Full_96 holds a project with a single-board 96% keyboard. This is the simplest and cheapest option.

Full_75 holds a project with a 75% keyboard PCB. This board has a connector on the left side that can supply power to the numpad.

Numpad holds a project with a standalone wired/wireless numpad, with the option for power delivery from the 75% board.

I made the project like this for a number of reasons, the most notable being my ability to 3D print an entire case/plate in one go on my Artillery Sidewinder X1. Other than that, options are nice, I guess. Regardless, the full 96% board exists in case I get access to a larger printer sometime in the future.
